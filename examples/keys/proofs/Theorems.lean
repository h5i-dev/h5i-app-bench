# Revocation holds across requests

`no_act_after_revoke`: in every serial run of requests from an empty database,
in any order and by any clients, once a key is revoked no later request acts
on its behalf, whether it presents the key or a session opened before the
revocation. The proof combines three one-step facts: an action needs a live key
(`act_live`), no revoked secret is live (`Inv`, kept by every command), and
revoked secrets stay revoked.
