# Time that never goes back

"Owners cancel before the start" should mean a started booking stays. The
kernel compares the start with the cancel request's time, so this needs a
clock that never goes back (`EngineConfig::monotonic`, modeled by
`ReachableT` and `StepsT`).

- `started_stays`: once a commit has happened at or after a booking's start,
  no run of commands by non-admins removes it.
- `clock_back_cancels`: without monotonic time this fails. After a commit at
  time 5, the owner of a booking that started at 1 cancels it at time 0.
