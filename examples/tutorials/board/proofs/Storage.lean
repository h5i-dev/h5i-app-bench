# What the store holds (A4)

The server stores a write set by running the planned statements of the
kernel's `sql_writes`, and loads a tenant by decoding its rows with the
kernel's `decode`. `I5hLib.Store` proves, for any schema, that the database
then holds exactly the encoding of the state `applyAll` computes. This file
instantiates it: the encoding of a state, the table writes of each write, and
that they agree with `applyWrite`.

`stored`: every database the server produces from an empty tenant reads back
exactly the rows of the state its commits computed, and loading it decodes to
that state, up to row order.

/-! ## The invariants on PostgreSQL

The chain from a command to the rows a later request loads: the extracted
`transition` accepts a write set (`Accepted`), `inv_preserved` keeps `Inv`,
the server stores the compiled statements of `sql_writes`, and a load runs
the compiled `SELECT`s and `decode`. `Schema.pg_loaded_inv` connects them. -/
