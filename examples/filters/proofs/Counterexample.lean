# Before the fix, a name rewrites the filter

`substitute_pre` escapes `\` but not `'`. Eve signs up with the name
`x'|owner='bob`; through `owner='$'` her search becomes
`owner='x'|owner='bob'`, and she sees Bob's records (`pre_leaks`). The fixed
kernel shows her none (`fixed_hides`), as `search_own` says it must.
