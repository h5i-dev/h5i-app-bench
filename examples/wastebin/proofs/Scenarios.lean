# Scenarios

Concrete runs of today's kernel. They show that the guarded cases happen:
the owner can delete and others cannot, a confirmed read burns the paste,
an unexpired paste is served until its expiry, and the right password opens
a locked paste. So the theorems do not hold because nothing is allowed.
